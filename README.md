- 👋 Hi, I’m @snipa-1337

- 👀 I’m interested in python programming applied to fire sciences. Besides that, I have a bachelor in Civil Engineering, so I have interest in digitalization of the construction sector. I am also trying to find ways to make Jupyter Notebooks even more beautiful for engineering applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, pandas and tensorflow.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on opensource projects related to fire safety, BIM and construction digitalization.
