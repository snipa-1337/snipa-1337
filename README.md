- 👋 Hi, I’m @snipa-1337

- 👀 I’m interested in python programming applied to machine learning and data science. Besides that, I have a bachelor in Civil Engineering, so I have interest in digitalization of the construction sector. I also have some interest in cloud applications, however, I have no knowledge in it so far.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, pandas, sklearn and tensorflow
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on opensource related to BIM and construction digitalization.
- 📫 How to reach me: The best way to reach me is through github itself
